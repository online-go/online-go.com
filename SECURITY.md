# Reporting Security Issues

The OGS team and community take security bugs in OGS seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email [anoek@online-go.com](mailto:anoek@online-go.com) and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

The OGS team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.
