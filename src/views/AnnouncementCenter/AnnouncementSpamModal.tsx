const MODAL_CONTENT = `## ðŸ“¢ Rule: One Announcement Per Event

To keep the community clear and avoid disruption:

- **Post only one announcement per event.**  
  Do not create multiple announcements for individual games, streams, or related items.  

- **Consolidate all details and links** into a single, well-organized hub.  
  Acceptable places include:  
  - a **forum post** (recommended)  
  - an **external event website** (if you maintain one)  

- **Use your hub post to direct users** to all related content.  

This policy reduces pop-ups, prevents redundant alerts, and keeps the community space accessible for everyone.`;
