// Compare players so that they sort into order. Guests sort last. In
// the event that two players sort equal, we then sort by id. This
// ensures that we get a consistent sort order in all cases.
//
// Typical usage:
//     players.sort(by_username);
//     players.sort(by_rating);
//
// Although slightly less efficient, we carry out all four type checks.
// This is because it makes the code more obviously correct, and
// correctness is more valuable than raw speed. The final pair of
// type checks (to ensure a and b are both registered players) is
// absolutely essential to reassure the type-checker that we know what
// we're doing in the body of the if-statement. Finally, if we do pass
// junk into the function (which the typechecker can't always prevent),
// we'll definitely get an exception or an undefined return value,
// rather than a silent bug.
//
// My style (setting cmp to 0 and then ||-ing the first condition) might
// seem a little odd to some. In my experience, it's extremely easy
// to rearrange the conditions and forget that the first one is written
// differently. It saves developer time in the long run to do it this way.
